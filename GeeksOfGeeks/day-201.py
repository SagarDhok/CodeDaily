# Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 41.77%Submissions: 174K+Points: 2Average Time: 20m
# You have given two sorted arrays a[] & b[] of distinct elements. The first array has one element extra added in between. Return the index of the extra element.

# Note: 0-based indexing is followed.

# Examples

# Input: a[] = [2,4,6,8,9,10,12], b[] = [2,4,6,8,10,12]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: In the first array, 9 is extra added and it's index is 4.
# Input: a[] = [3,5,7,8,11,13], b[] = [3,5,7,11,13]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: In the first array, 8 is extra and it's index is 3.
# Input: a[] = [3,5], b[] = [3]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: In the first array, 5 is extra and it's index is 1.
# Constraints:
# 2<=arr1.size()<=105
# 1<=arr1[i],arr2[i]<=106
