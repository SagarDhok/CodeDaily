#! Common in 3 Sorted Arrays
# Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 22.16%Submissions: 441K+Points: 2
# Given three sorted arrays in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in non-decreasing order across these arrays. If there are no such elements return an empty array. In this case, the output will be -1.

# Note: can you handle the duplicates without using any additional Data Structure?

# Examples :

# Input: arr1 = [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80] , arr2 = [6, 7, 20, 80, 100] , arr3 = [3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120]
# Output: [20, 80]
# Explanation: 20 and 80 are the only common elements in arr1, arr2 and arr3.
# Input: arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] , arr2 = [6, 7] , arr3 = [8,9,10]
# Output: [-1]
# Explanation: There are no common elements in arr1, arr2 and arr3.
# Input: arr1 = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], arr2 = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2], arr3 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
# Output: [1, 2]
# Explanation: We do not need to consider duplicates
# Constraints:
# 1 <= arr1.size(), arr2.size(), arr3.size() <= 105
# -105 <= arr1i , arr2i , 1arr3i <= 105
